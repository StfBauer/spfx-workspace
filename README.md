### npm / yarn workspace test

This demo shows that SPFx do not work properly with npm and yarn workspaces. Both monorepo mechanism provide the minimal requirement for a monorepo.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

NPM install create node modules directly from the root folder. There will be no node_modules folder created under the SPFx project.

## Run SPFx project

```bash
# from webpart247 folder run gulp serve
webpart247$ gulp serve
```
